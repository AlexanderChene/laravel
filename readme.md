# laravel

This is Laravel version 5.2

# Controller:
app/Controllers/routes.php -------- Set up the route for website with Route::get function and also catch the parameter from URL

Http/Controllers/PostController.php ----- Helper class for route


# View:

resources/views : conact.blade.php, post.blade.view and welcome.blade.view
These three are the view of the application. I used the layout setup for blade file to avoid repeating code for UI such as extend, section and end.

# Model:

database/migations : Create mysql database with php artisan migration. 
Implement CRUD for backend mysql database with Laravel DB functionS
Operate Database Eloquent Relationships such as 1 to 1, inverse and many to many relationships
